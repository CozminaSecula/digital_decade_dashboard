Each sub-dimension has its key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nThe goal for this dashboard is two-fold:\n\n- To visualize how selected KPIs for each dimension performed in 2023 compared with 2021\n- To visualize how EU member states progressed for selected KPIs\n\nThe visualizations are organized into one page for each dimension.\n \n:::\n\n\n## KPIs Definitions\n\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\"}\n## AI\n\nArtificial intelligence, measured as the percentage of enterprises using at least one artificial intelligence technology such as:\n\n- text mining\n- speech recognition\n- natural language generation\n- image recognition and processing\n- machine learning (e.g., deep learning) for data analysis\n- AI based software robotic process automation\n- autonomous robots\n- self-driving vehicles\n- autonomous drones.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\"}\n## Cloud Computing\n\nCloud computing, measured as the percentage of enterprises using at least one of the following cloud computing services:\n\n- finance or accounting\n- software applications\n- enterprise resource planning (ERP) software applications\n- customer relationship management (CRM) software applications\n- security software applications\n- hosting the enterprise’s database(s)\n- computing platform providing a hosted environment for application development, testing or deployment.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\"}\n## Data Analytics\nIn 2023, Eurostat replaced the Big Data indicator with the Data Analytics one.\nData analytics refers to the use of technologies, techniques or software tools for analysing data to extract patterns, trends and insights to make conclusions, and predictions and ensure better decision-making with the aim of improving performance (e.g., increase production, reduce costs). Data may be extracted from your own enterprise’ data source or from external sources (e.g., suppliers, customers, government). \n\nData Analytics includes a broader set of technologies than the former Big Data.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\"}\n## AI or Cloud or Data analytics\nArtificial Intelligence or Cloud computing services or Data analytics. This indicator is available and calculated for the first time in 2023.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout collapse=\"true\"}\n## Basic level of digital intensity\nSMEs with at least a basic level of digital intensity, measured as the percentage of SMEs using at least 4 of 12 selected digital technologies.\n\nThe 2023 survey included the following 12 technologies and/or criteria (source Eurostat):\n\n- Enterprises where more than 50% of the persons employed used computers with access\nto the internet for business purposes;\n- Have ERP software package to share information between different functional areas; - The maximum contracted download speed of the fastest fixed line internet connection is at least 30 Mb/s; \n- Enterprises where web sales were more than 1% of the total turnover and B2C web sales more than 10% of the web sales; \n- Data analytics for the enterprise is performed by the enterprise's own employees or by an external provider; \n- Use any social media;\n- Have customer relationship management (CRM) software; \n- Buy sophisticated or intermediate cloud computing services; \n- Use any AI technology; \n- Buy cloud computing services used over the internet;\n- Used any computer networks for sales (at least 1%);\n- Use two or more social media\n\nThe Enterprise survey questions used for the definition of the Digital Intensity Index vary every year but in 2023 most of the technologies are the same as those of the 2021survey. The list used by year is provided by Eurostat.\n\n:::\n\n# Businesses {orientation=\"columns\"}\n\n## Column {width=\"33%\"}\n### Row {height=\"35%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell title='Statistical Population'
